## About contents

### ansible.cfg

An example of ansible.cfg based on [Official ansible.cfg Example] .
The differences are like the following.

- Use inventory in the project directory (not /etc/ansible/hosts)
- Add roles directoy in the project directory 

[Official ansible.cfg Example]: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/examples/ansible.cfg

###  hosts

An example of inventory file.
This inventory includes the top leve group and sample child group.

### group_vars

Most of variables used in roles are changed via hosts_vars.

`.gitignore` file includes `group_vars/production/99_private`.
You can write private variables (e.g. AMI ID) in the file.

### roles

- ec2_create
- ec2_start
- ec2_stop

### playbook directory

Playbooks for configuring and operating machines.

The sub-directries are separated intto `conf` and `op` .

`conf` includes playbooks for the configuration. e.g. installing middleware

`op` includes playbooks for the operation. e.g. starting middleware

## How to execute

Before executing Ansible playbooks, you need to configure AWS credentials.
In this procedure, we assume that the credentials are configured using the profile, "ec2".
